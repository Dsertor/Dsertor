# Hi, welcome to my Github!

I'm Sergio Rolando Martinez, a web development student, and I'd like to showcase my projects and what I'm currently working on.

## My projects
### [FilmView](https://dsertor.github.io/FilmView/index.html) 
I had to develop a website on a theme defined by me, taking into account the color palette, making it responsive, and having the homepage divided into four sections. I used some Javascript, however, I had limited time to complete this project, and in the future, I would like to add more interactivity to it.

### [Spotify clone](https://github.com/Dsertor/Spotify-clone) (WIP)
This is a project built with React and TypeScript that replicates Spotify’s web interface using endpoints from its API

### [Xiaomi SO]() (WIP)
In this project, I’m trying to clone the development of a Redmi 13 Pro, from powering it on to building some apps.
